If you think about it this is a natural progression, considering that messaging is the root of all mobile communication. 50% of U.S. mobile users haven\u2019t downloaded an app in the last year, but billions of people are already using messaging apps. Platforms like Facebook Messenger, Kik, and WhatsApp have a combined user-base of more than one billion. Even just Kik alone has more than 300 million users who have exchanged more than 350 million messages with bots.<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/blakemorgan\/2017\/03\/21\/how-chatbots-will-transform-customer-experience-an-infographic\/#268756857fb4<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Why \u2018talk to our chatbot\u2019 will replace \u2018send us an email\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>Chatbot interactions like this go beyond replacing retail inquiries and tech support questions. This type of bot already exists, at least to some extent (even if the A.I. is fairly rudimentary at this point in bot evolution). I want a chatbot for more than sales and support; I want one for almost every situation where email is the preferred mode of communication. I\u2019d ask about my college tuition payment for one of my kids, check with a state park bot about reserving a camping site, and even use one on the job \u2014 asking a PR bot to schedule an interview for me. If I need to contact an individual, I\u2019d talk to a personal chatbot instead of sending an email, and perhaps find out that the person is in Lisbon on vacation. I\u2019d interact with the bot instead and get the information I need. No email chain equals success.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5m1LkHLhHx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2016\/09\/25\/why-talk-to-our-chatbot-will-replace-send-us-an-email\/\">Why \u2018talk to our chatbot\u2019 will replace \u2018send us an email\u2019<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Why \u2018talk to our chatbot\u2019 will replace \u2018send us an email\u2019&#8221; &#8212; VentureBeat\" src=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2016\/09\/25\/why-talk-to-our-chatbot-will-replace-send-us-an-email\/embed\/#?secret=5m1LkHLhHx\" data-secret=\"5m1LkHLhHx\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h1>The Importance of Chatbots in Every Business<\/h1>\n<p>Chatbots are gaining more popularity than ever and they are totally bringing new ways of how businesses run marketing.

The chatbot industry is expected to witness significant growth over the forecast period as they enable enterprises to substantially reduce operating costs. Additionally, innovations in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are likely to enhance the features of chatbots, which acts as a major driver for the market.<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/press-release\/global-chatbot-market<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Chatbots Will Appeal to Modern Workers<\/h2>\n<p>Chatbots continue to be a hot topic among media, end users and vendor communities. This is no surprise as chatbots \u2014 which use artificial intelligence (AI) to mimic human conversations \u2014 are expected to become widespread within the next two to three years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBy 2020, over 50% of medium to large enterprises will have deployed product chatbots,\u201d said Van Baker, research vice president at Gartner, while at the Gartner Application Architecture, Development &amp; Integration Summit, held March 12-13 in Mumbai.<br \/>\nhttps:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/chatbots-will-appeal-to-modern-workers\/<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>4 Uses for Chatbots in the Enterprise<\/h2>\n<p>Four potential uses of chatbot platforms that exist in enterprises today include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u00a0Call center help desk: Specialized chatbots can potentially reduce the number of help desk workers, by facilitating the handling of routine requests via automated chatbot responses.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0ChatOps approvals: A change in a back-end record will trigger an event, which can cause a message to be delivered to an enterprise messaging or workflow environment requesting an employee responds to \u201capprove,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d or \u201cdefer\u201d in the app.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0Equipment diagnostic inventory management: When implemented in conjunction with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, warehouse workers can be notified when a product is out of stock, or if a shipment has arrived at the loading dock that contains out-of-stock items.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0Chatbot scheduling agent: Requires both the use of AI and bot-to-bot communication. The chatbot will likely call another bot that uses AI to initiate a messaging stream combined with calendar access, in an effort to find open time on multiple calendars.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">h<\/span>ttps:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/4-uses-for-chatbots-in-the-enterprise\/<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/newsroom\/id\/3858564<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Chatbot trends to look forward to in 2018<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cBy 2021, more than 50% of enterprises will be spending more per annum on bots and chatbot creations than traditional mobile app developments. Gartner is predicting that by 2020, 55% of all large enterprises will have deployed (used in production) at least one bot or chatbot. Rapid advances in natural-language processing (NLP) make today&#8217;s chatbots much better at recognizing the user intent than previous generations. According to Gartner\u2019s predictions study, NLP is used to determine the entry point for the decision tree in a chatbot, but a majority of chatbots still use scripted responses in a decision tree.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Kia is seeing 3 times more conversions through its chatbot than its website<br \/>\nAt last count, Kia had more than 800 websites where a customer can ask about buying a car.<\/p>\n<p>In November, to try and simplify the process, Kia launched Kian, a Facebook Messenger and chatbot, in order to have a direct source for all the information that users might search for. In the four months since its launch, Kia has gotten three times more conversions through Kian than through its main website, Kia.com.<\/p>\n<p>The conversion rate through Kian is 21 percent, while conversions through Kia.com are at 7 percent, according to Nathalie Choy, national manager of digital, social and CRM marketing at Kia Motors America.<\/p>\n<p>Customers aren\u2019t shying away from asking their questions.
